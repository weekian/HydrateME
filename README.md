# HydrateME

HydrateME Ionic Mobile Application created as part of project for Internet of Things (IoT) module for undergraduate studies

Executive Summary
------
A significant proportionof children aged 7 to 12 are not sufficiently hydrated. This adversely affects their cognitive development, 
ability to focus and a build-up of toxins in their body. They are more susceptible to dehydration and its effects due to an immature 
thirst mechanism and higher rates of water loss to the environment. Existing solutions, such as theHealth Promotion Board’s Lets
Drink Watercampaign, installation of water coolers in schools and IoT-enabled smart water bottles,do not promote proper hydration 
habits effectively or are not viable on a large scale.  Our proposed solution is to track the volume of water dispensed for students
at water coolers through installing and distributing sensors on water coolers and to students respectively. Students can view their 
current usage and receive automated notifications when there is insufficient dispensation (and consumption). Teachers can easily 
identify negligent students while parents can monitor their child’s hydration
